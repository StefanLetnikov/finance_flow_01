# finance_flow_01
This is a multiplatform dart flutter application, build for a homework project, for keeping track of expenses. It allows the user to enter thir daily expenses, and view them by date.
It has a local storage so it is not depndent on any outside service.
Main attributes and metodologies used are a form of MVC principles for the "architechture", and both for the back-end and fron-end handeling Dart's Flutter has been used. The database provider used for the storage is HIVE. To display the entered expenses a list view has been used, and to serach by date in the past a calendar widget has been used. Avery display I have used is customly designed for this homework project.
